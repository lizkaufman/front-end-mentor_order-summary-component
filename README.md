## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS variables
- Media queries

### What I learned

Through this project, I practiced:

- Getting better at using the elements' hierarchy when selecting
- Working to a design, eyeballing distances, sizes, etc. just from pictures
- Box shadows

### Continued development

After this project, I want to get better at:

- Writing more concise CSS
- Getting better at spacing rather than stabbing in the dark with margins and paddings a bit haphazardly
- Not using flexbox as a catch-all/crutch
- Being more mobile-first
- Practicing using a tool or framework (like Tailwind), not just vanilla CSS
